### Hello!

Welcome to my `README` page.

**UPDATE 30 Jan 2024:**
<p>I am resetting my GitHub account -- deleting old/unmaintained repositories, updating forks, etc. -- along with my blog [Just A Data Geek](https://justadatageek.com/) in the hopes of motivating myself to do more analytical work.</p>
<p>I plan to focus on R, though I may do some work in Python as well.</p>
<p>I'll be using this space to post updates, which will be dated like this one.  All of my new work will be in a yet-to-be-created repo.  My previous work from blogs, etc., is available in various repos in my account.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking this out, and keep an eye out for updates!</p>
<br>
