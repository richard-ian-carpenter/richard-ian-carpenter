### Hello!
<br>
Welcome to my `README` page.
<br>
<p>**UPDATE 30 Jan 2024:**</p>
<p>I am resetting my GitHub repository -- deleting old repos, updating forks, etc. -- with the hopes of motivating myself to do more analytical work.
I plan to focus on R, though I may do some work in Python as well.
I'll be using the space to post updates, which will be dated.  All of my work will be in a yet-to-be-created repository.  My previous work from blogs, etc., is available.</p>
<br>
